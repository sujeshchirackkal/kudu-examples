##Here's a Java client sample, written in Scala, that creates a table, writes some data, scans it, and then deletes its table. 

This project is created as an sbt project. To set up sbt, download version 0.13.9 from

http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html

Extract sbt to a folder on your machine (ex: YOUR_HOME/tools/sbt) or follow the instructions at

http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/tutorial/Manual-Installation.html

Now change your location to the scala code root, where you have cloned this project.

>cd PATHTOTHISSAMPLECODE/scala
 
 run sbt
 
>YOUR_HOME/tools/sbt/bin/sbt

You must be into sbt console now
 
> `>compile`

> `>run`

Alternatively you can run the project from a SCALA IDE.(Intellij with Scala plugin or Eclipse Scala IDE)

Prerequisites:
  Set up the demo VM as per the instructions given at https://github.com/cloudera/kudu-examples
